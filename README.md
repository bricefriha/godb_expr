This is an experimental project to explore the boundaries of GoLang.
The Godb_expr is a database engine utilising JSON files (as sheets). Similar to MangoDb.

> THIS PROJECT HAS NO PRETENSION AT ALL; DO NOT USE THIS TO INSULT MY LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF A MARKET. INSTEAD, I WOULD INVITE YOU TO USE ANY OTHER OF MY OTHER PROJECTS

## Functions
- `- exc`: To execute any query

e.g.: ```go run main.go -exc "CREATE TABLE animalList.animal"```
## Properties

### Bear in mind
- Property names that start with '€' are auto-generated by the engine and can not be changed by the user. e.g.: `€id`, `€insertedAt`, `€lastUpdatedAt`


...I'm not done with this readme...

## Contribute

2. Clone your fork
3. run: `go run main.go`

>⚠️ you need Go installed, obviously
